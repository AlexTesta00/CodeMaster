# 🚀 CodeMaster

CodeMaster allows you to post programming problems directly on the platform, with the possibility to compose solutions using various programming languages (e.g., Java, Kotlin, Scala).  
The idea is to create an interactive, educational, and collaborative environment aimed at improving programming and problem-solving skills.
